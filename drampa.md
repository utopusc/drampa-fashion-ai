## Key Risks and Considerations

### Technical Risks
- [ ] AI Integration Complexity: Stable Diffusion API integration and particularly the "product dressing" functionality may be more complex than anticipated. Additional time might be needed during Weeks 9-10.
- [ ] Performance Issues: Generating and manipulating high-quality images might cause performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] API Costs: Monitor usage costs for Hugging Face or other AI APIs to stay within budget.

### Scope Limitations for MVP
- 3D visualization (React Three Fiber) deferred to next phase
- Complex sharing features limited to basic functionality
- Advanced editing tools kept minimal

### Priority Features
- Basic model creation
- Simple product dressing capability
- Image saving and management

## Environment Setup

### Development Environment
- [ ] Node.js (v18+)
- [ ] npm/yarn/pnpm
- [ ] Git
- [ ] VS Code with recommended extensions
- [ ] Supabase CLI

### Production Environment
- [ ] Vercel/Netlify for frontend hosting
- [ ] Supabase for backend services
- [ ] Hugging Face account with API access
